    message: Press SpaceBar
  - speakerName: Capsule
    message: Josh had spent year and year accumulating the information. He knew it
      inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field,
      Josh would be the one to call. The problem was that there was nobody interested
      in the information besides him and he knew it. Years of information painstakingly
      memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the
      topic.
  - speakerName: Capsule
    message: He heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result. It had been
      so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat. As soon as he
      recovered from the surprise, he saw the crack in the windshield. It seemed
      to be an analogy of the current condition of his life.
  - speakerName: Capsule
    message: He ordered his regular breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, hash browns,
      and two strips of bacon. He continued to look at the menu wondering if this
      would be the day he added something new. This was also part of the routine.
      A few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the
      order before demuring and saying that would be all. It was the same exact meal
      that he had ordered every day for the past two years.
